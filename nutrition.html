        <h1>Principles of safe and healthy weight loss</h1>
        <span><p>The mechanism of weight loss is that the body uses more energy than it absorbs when eating and taking nutrients.</p>
            At that time, the body will use its internal energy reserves such as fat of excess fat or muscle, leading to weight loss, improving the state of obesity.

            The weight loss diet offers the benefit of a healthier body because it is low in carbs or 
            low in fat, limiting sweets, and loaded with nutritious foods only. One study proved that after 
            3 months, people who stick to a weight loss diet had fewer cravings, namely less cravings for sweets, 
            fast foods, and starches. To achieve your weight loss goals in a healthy and safe way, you need to adjust 
            your diet, eat a balanced diet, and increase your physical activity and exercise.

        <p style="font-weight: 600; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;">What is BMI?</p>
        <span>Currently, the World Health Organization often uses the Body Mass Index ( BMI ) to identify 
            the underweight status. Before designing your meal plan, you need to calculate your BMI to know 
            your body weight status as follows:</span>
        <p style="font-weight: 600; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;">BMI = Weight / (height * height)</p>
        <span class="bmi">Height in meters. Weight in kg

            BMI in the range of 18.5-23 means you have a fit body and are not called obese.
            
            However, there are many people who have a normal BMI but still look fat, that is 
            due to a lot of excess fat, concentrated in easily visible areas such as the abdomen, 
            thighs, buttocks, biceps. Therefore, the weight loss menu is not necessarily used for obese 
            people, but even for those who want to change and improve their physique by eating.</span>
